                    The Sequence Manipulation Suite is written in JavaScript
                    1.5, which is a lightweight, cross-platform, object-oriented
                    scripting language. JavaScript is now standardized by the
                    ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association). The
                    first version of the ECMA standard is documented in the
                    ECMA-262 specification. The ECMA-262 standard is also
                    approved by the ISO (International Organization for
                    Standards) as ISO-16262. JavaScript 1.5 is fully compatible
                    with ECMA-262, Edition 3.<br />
                    <br />
                    Sequences submitted to the Sequence Manipulation Suite do
                    not leave your computer and are instead manipulated by your
                    web browser, which executes the JavaScript. The Sequence
                    Manipulation Suite was written by Paul Stothard (University
                    of Alberta, Canada). Send questions and comments to

                        moving across the sequence at 1 bp intervals. CpG
                        islands are defined as sequence ranges where the Obs/Exp

                        is calculated as the number of 'C's in the window
